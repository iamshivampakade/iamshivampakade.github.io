👋 Hi, I’m **Shivam Pakade** — an **Information Security Researcher** and **Red Team Learner** passionate about exploring the offensive and defensive sides of cybersecurity.  

I’m currently advancing my expertise through the **CDAC DITISS (Diploma in IT Infrastructure, Systems, and Security)** program, where I’ve gained a strong foundation in:

- 🔐 **Network Security** – Packet analysis, firewall configuration, and intrusion detection  
- 💻 **System Administration** – Linux/Windows hardening, Active Directory, and server management  
- 🧠 **Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing** – Vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and report writing  
- ☁️ **Cloud & Virtualization** – Securing cloud environments and managing virtual labs for simulations  
- 🧩 **Security Tools** – Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark, Nessus, and OWASP frameworks  

My current learning journey focuses on **Red Team operations**, **threat emulation**, and **post-exploitation techniques**, while continuously researching new methods in adversary simulation and cyber defense.

Through this blog, I aim to share my learnings, practical experiences, and security research projects — from lab setups to real-world attack simulations — to contribute to the infosec community.

💬 *Let’s connect and grow together in the world of cybersecurity!*
