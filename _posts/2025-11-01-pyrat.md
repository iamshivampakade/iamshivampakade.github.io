## Overview {#overview}

Pyrat is a TryHackMe room focused on finding exposed credentials in the target system (often inside a repository, config file or backup) and using them to gain access. This walkthrough documents the commands and logic I used to retrieve credentials and capture the user flag.

---

## Recon and service discovery {#recon-and-service-discovery}

Start with basic scanning to discover open ports and services:

```bash
# fast port scan for common ports
nmap -Pn -sV -p- $IP -T4 -oN nmap_full.txt

# or targeted quick scan
nmap -Pn -sV -p22,80,443,8080 $IP -oN nmap_quick.txt
```

Look for common services: SSH (22) and web (80/8080). If web is present, enumerate directories:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://$IP -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x php,txt,html,zip
```

When you find web applications, look for obvious download points, exposed `.git` directories, backups or developer folders (e.g. `/dev`, `/backup`, `/uploads`, `/repo`).

---

## Finding credentials {#finding-credentials}

A frequent source of credentials is an accidentally exposed `.git` or developer folder. If you find a path like `/opt/dev/` (or a `.git` tree), check for config files and credential leaks.

Example commands I used on the box:

```bash
# if you can access filesystem (via web or mounted volume), check for .git config
cat /opt/dev/.git/config
```

The `.git/config` may include `user` metadata. Also check the config or any `credentials` file that might contain `username`/`password` for remote origins:

```
[credential "https://github.com"]
  username = think
  password = <redacted_password_here>
```

**Screenshot — git config showing username / password**
![git credentials excerpt]({{ '/assets/img/TryHackMe/Pyrat/username&pass.jpg' | relative_url }})

If the password is obfuscated or hashed / partial, either:

* use the discovered credential directly to SSH/HTTP if it's plaintext, or
* brute-force the remaining portion using a small script or wordlist.

---

## Cracking and using the credentials {#cracking-and-using-credentials}

If the credential requires brute force (partial or unknown), a simple Python script or `hydra`/`medusa` can be used. Example (the screenshot shows a small brute script that found the password):

```bash
# Example (high level)
python3 brute.py --target think --user think --pattern "<known-prefix>???" --wordlist passwords.txt
# The script prints: [+] Password found: Th1sIsP@ss
```

**Screenshot — brute script output (password found)**
![brute found password]({{ '/assets/img/TryHackMe/Pyrat/pass.jpg' | relative_url }})

Once you have credentials, try SSH:

```bash
ssh think@<IP>
# or if git creds for https are for a remote, try them on the web app login
```

If SSH accepts the password, you have a shell as the `think` user. Immediately enumerate the home directory and check for flags.

---

## Initial access and user flag {#initial-access-and-user-flag}

After logging in as the discovered user, collect basic facts:

```bash
id
whoami
hostname
ls -la
```

Common places for the user flag are the user’s home directory or a file named `user.txt`:

```bash
ls
cat user.txt
```

**Screenshot — user flag captured**
![user flag]({{ '/assets/img/TryHackMe/Pyrat/user_flag.jpg' | relative_url }})

In my session I used the recovered username/password and obtained the user flag successfully.

## Notes, tools & mitigations {#notes-tools-and-mitigations}

### Tools used

* `nmap` — port/service discovery
* `gobuster` — web directory discovery
* `cat`, `less`, `grep` — local file inspection
* small Python brute script — for targeted password discovery

### Defensive notes / mitigation suggestions

* **Never store plaintext credentials** in repositories or config files. Use credential stores, environment variables with proper access control, or secrets managers.
* **Disable credential caching in repo configs** or ensure `.git` is not exposed over web paths.
* **Rotate and remove leaked credentials** immediately when discovered.
* Apply principle of least privilege — service accounts should have minimal permissions.

---



* Add an automated reproduction script (takes the leaked config, extracts creds and attempts SSH), or
* Re-arrange images inside the post to match each step more precisely — tell me which screenshot you prefer for which section and I’ll update the MD file.
